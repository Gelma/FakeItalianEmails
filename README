== What's this? ==

A stupid script to generate fake italian email addresses.
We use them for honeypot on lugbs.linux.it domain.
Names and surnames are real and human checked.

== Can I help you? ==

Of course! There are a lot of things to do!

About list name/surname:
- add entries
- remove foreign entries
	- surname: A-M already done
	- check Name and Nomi_seconda_lista_da_controllare.txt before merge
	- merge Cognomi_lista_di_Livio.txt without check
	- merge Cognomi_ok_da_unire_poi.txt Nomi_ok_da_unire_poi.txt without check
